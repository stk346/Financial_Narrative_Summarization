We have maintained our focus on  delivering sustainable growth in recurring  profits and cash flows over the long term,  and on delivering a Home for Success for  all the students who live with us. We do this  by providing great service and operating  brilliant buildings, designed specifically for  students. Our investment discipline ensures  we maintain a robust capital structure and  deliver high-quality earnings. Performance in 2017 resulted in  another year of growth in EPRA earnings,  like-for-like rents and development profits.  EPRA earnings increased by 12% to £70.5  million and now represents one-third of total  shareholder returns. The focus on delivery  of the ongoing earnings performance of  the business is increasingly underpinned  by University backed contracts giving us  the confidence to increase our dividend  pay-out from 75% to 85% of EPRA EPS  in 2018. We will continue to focus on growing  earnings, both in absolute terms and as a  proportion of our total return. This is driven  by our ability to maintain full occupancy,  to continue growing rental levels on an  annual basis, the consistent focus on cost  efficiencies and from the completion of  our high-quality development pipeline. Our PRISM operating platform,  which became fully operational in  2016, coupled with our experienced  management and leadership teams, give  us a unique capability to drive value from  our portfolio through scale efficiencies and  revenue management, supporting our  ongoing income focus.  We have actively prioritised improving  the quality of our portfolio by using  our customer insight and extensive  local knowledge to align with the top  performing Universities. We completed  two important strategic initiatives during  the year with the acquisition of a 3,067- bed, on-campus portfolio at Aston  University and the sale of 4,800 beds  that did not meet the long-term strategic  goals of our portfolio. These initiatives are  supported by our ongoing development  activity and further University partnership  opportunities to ensure that we are  increasingly focused on the best  Universities in the UK. Delivering for students Our business is focused on delivering  a Home for Success: an affordable,  consistent and high quality living  environment that helps students make  the most of their time at University. Going  to University should be more than simply  a stepping stone to employment and  we strongly believe that where a student  lives has a material impact on their social  and academic development. We strive to  ensure that every aspect of our student  proposition is therefore designed to  provide a safe and secure environment  where they can integrate and develop,  academically and socially. Our student proposition is delivered by  1,400 highly experienced employees,  whose understanding of students is a  cornerstone of our success. As part of our  strategy, we continue to invest in recruiting,  retaining and developing the very best  people. This commitment is reflected in  the results of our employee effectiveness  surveys and the prestigious Investors in  People Gold Standard accreditation and  we are pleased to have achieved the  Living Wage Employer accreditation.  We also recognise that going to University  is a significant investment for young people  and offer a variety of accommodation  at different price points, with the majority  of our rooms concentrated at a mid- range price point for purpose-built  student accommodation. Financial highlights EPRA earnings £70.5m  12% EPRA EPS £30.3p  7% Profit before tax £229.4m  14% Basic EPS 95.3p  6% Dividend per share 22.7p  26% EPRA NAV per share 720p  11% Total accounting return 14% Loan-to-value 31% Richard Smith Chief Executive Officer Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 15 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED This commitment to the customer is  reflected in average occupancy of  98% and rental growth of 3.5% over  the last five years. Growing numbers  of second and third year students, who  have traditionally preferred to live in private  rented accommodation, are choosing to  return to us and now account for over  two-thirds of our direct-let bookings.  Customer service satisfaction levels, a key  performance indicator for us, remain at  consistently high levels and place us on  a par with some of the best service  companies across Europe. Partner of choice for Universities Our focus on customer service is closely  aligned with the priorities of our University  partners, for whom student experience is  now a key performance metric under the  Government’s new Teaching Excellence  Framework. With students spending more  time in their accommodation than on  campus, we can increasingly demonstrate  to Universities how Home for Success  supports their strategic ambitions.  This, combined with a long standing  commitment to building relationships with  key University decision–makers, is reflected  in the latest results of our independently  assessed University trust survey and means  that 60% of our accommodation is now  let to Universities through nominations  agreements. With an average remaining  life of six years, these agreements provide  income and rental growth certainty on  over half of our revenue. The delivery of great customer service  to students and Universities has translated  into a strong financial performance in 2017 ,  delivering occupancy of 99% and rental  growth of 3.4% (2016: 98%, 3.8%). With our  new operating system, PRISM, we have also  delivered further improvements to our NOI  margin and overhead efficiency measure. Our people, University relationships,  the quality of our portfolio and PRISM,  our operating platform, set us apart from  the other operators in the sector. Going  forward, I am confident they will support  the future growth and financial  performance of the business. Operating quality buildings The quality, location and scale of our  portfolio is a key component of our  business model and long-term strategy.  We aim to operate buildings in and  around high quality Universities, where  student demand is highest. We believe  that our focus on these institutions is the  best strategy for driving continued high  levels of occupancy and rental growth.  We are therefore focusing our portfolio  activity on further improving alignment  to high and mid ranked Universities and,  in the process, underpinning rental  growth over the medium and long  term. We currently have 85% of our beds  occupied by students attending such  Universities, which will increase to 90% on  completion of our existing development  pipeline, planned acquisitions  and disposals. During 2017 , we opened 2,150 new beds,  added 3,067 beds to our portfolio through  the Aston Student Village acquisition and  sold 4,800 beds. Taking into account these  activities, together with valuation  movements, the value of our investment  portfolio (including our share of USAF and  LSAV) is £2.4 billion as at 31 December 2017 . The purpose-built student accommodation  sector continues to attract a significant  level of institutional capital. Over £4 billion  of assets were traded in the year, driving  yield compression across the sector.  The yield movement on our portfolio,  on a like-for-like basis, was 15 basis points  and the portfolio is valued at an average  portfolio yield of 5.2% (2016: £2.1 billion  and 5.45% yield). 16 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Development pipeline We also made excellent progress  with our development pipeline during  the year. We completed five new  buildings over the summer and secured  an additional two new development  schemes, which increases our secured  development pipeline for delivery over  the next three years to 7 ,550 beds. The  construction of all our 2018 openings is  progressing in line with plans. Planning  consents and build contracts are in  place for all of our 2019 deliveries and  we are finalising our plans for schemes  delivering in 2020. During 2017 , USAF completed its two  forward-fund schemes in Oxford and  Edinburgh and acquired three further  forward-fund schemes in Durham and  Birmingham, adding 1,000 beds to the  portfolio on completion in 2018 and 2019. The anticipated yield on cost of our  secured development pipeline is 8.1%  and prospective returns on new schemes  outside London remain attractive at  around 8.0%. The secured development  pipeline is highly accretive and remains  a significant component of our future  earnings growth and could contribute  10–12 pence per share to EPRA earnings  once built out. University partnerships Following the success of the Aston University  transaction, Unite has secured two further  University partnership schemes. Firstly,  during the year, we acquired the former  Cowley Barracks in Oxford. Working with  Oxford Brookes University, we have secured  planning permission to build 887 beds and  agreed terms for a 25-year nominations  agreement with the University, taking our  partnership with them to over 1,365 beds.  The agreement provides the University with  much-needed accommodation and Unite  with income and rental growth certainty  over the long term. Secondly, following the year  end, Unite recently secured a new  development site in London. Working  with planning support from King’s  College, London we will submit a planning  application to build around 1,000 beds of  cluster-flat accommodation in the second  half of the year. We expect to enter into a  long-term nominations agreement over  this property, providing much needed  capacity in a location where there is a  severe shortage of high quality affordable  student accommodation. This is our first  land acquisition in London since 2013,  facilitated by the correction in land values  seen in certain zone 1 locations and our  ability to unlock value through our  relationships with Universities. The initial development returns on these  University-backed schemes are 6–7%,  around 100 basis points lower than a  scheme where Unite takes full letting and  rental growth risk. However, total returns are  expected to be 9–10% and given the  University relationships and the security of  income the agreements provide, these  opportunities are strategically important  and remain value enhancing. We continue to see attractive  development and partnership  opportunities in strong University markets  and we plan to invest selectively in target  markets to enhance portfolio quality and  deliver target returns. Q&A with the Chief Executive Richard Smith addresses some topical   questions from our shareholders Q What is the impact of the new  Teaching Excellence Framework on  your strategy? A The TEF results reinforce our strategy  of partnering with mid- to high-ranking  Universities. Currently 85% of our beds are  aligned to these types of institutions, and  with new developments such as Cowley  in Oxford and Middlesex Street in London,  we are expecting this to grow to 90%  on completion of our existing  development pipeline.  Student satisfaction and retention  are key measures of TEF, and we  believe our strategy can help our  University partners excel in these areas,  continuing to make us an attractive  accommodation partner.  Q You bought and sold more properties  than in previous years in 2017. Why?  A The quality of our portfolio is a key  differentiator between Unite and our  competitors. We continually review it to  ensure we have the best properties, in the  right locations, and are aligned with mid-  to high-ranking Universities, supporting the  quality earnings profile of the business.  This strategy drives both our acquisitions,  and our disposal activity. By disposing of  properties which no longer fit our quality  criteria, we can continue to invest in  new, exciting opportunities such as our  acquisition of Aston Student Village.   Read more in our   Property review on p36 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 17 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED Acquisitions and disposals We also continue to target acquisitions  of completed assets and portfolios that  enhance the quality of our portfolio and  the earnings profile of the business. These  acquisitions are generally targeted through  our co-investment vehicles due to their  lower cost of capital, allowing us to  generate enhanced returns through our  asset management and acquisition fees.  During 2017 , USAF acquired one 437-bed  completed asset in Sheffield for £36 million.  Since the year end, USAF has acquired  a 331-bed investment asset in Edinburgh  for £24 million. Disposals remain an important part  of our strategy and we will continue  to recycle assets out of our portfolio to  ensure that we can continue increasing  our exposure to the UK’s best Universities,  while generating capital to invest in  further development activity and exciting  opportunities such as the Aston Student  Village acquisition. During 2017 , we sold  £181 million of assets at a £5 million  premium to book valuations (Unite share).  We intend to sell £75–125 million (Unite  share) of assets during 2018 to take  advantage of the ongoing strength in  the investment market and to ensure  that we maintain a strong and flexible  balance sheet as we progress our  development pipeline.  High-quality earnings and a strong  capital structure We have achieved 99% occupancy  across our portfolio and rental growth of  3.4%. With 60% of this income underpinned  by University nominations agreements, we  have a high level of visibility in the ongoing  occupancy and rental growth outlook of  the portfolio. In addition to revenue growth,  a focus on efficiency has resulted in further  improvements in our NOI margin, which is up  to 7 4.1% (2016: 73.1%), and in our overhead  efficiency which shows that our overheads,  net of management fees, represents 40  basis points of gross asset value (2016: 40  basis points). Having put in place a £5 million  efficiency programme in 2017 (Unite share:  £3.8 million), we remain confident about  achieving further efficiency gains and  delivering our targets of 75% and 25–30 basis  points by the end of 2018 and will continue  to review how to deliver further efficiencies  in 2019 and beyond. Unite’s share of net debt grew by £27 million  to £803 million in 2017 . The majority of our  property and development expenditure  (Unite share £185 million) was funded by our  disposal programme with the remainder  from retained earnings. We reduced LTV to  31% (2017: 34%) as a result of disposals, the  conversion of the convertible bond and  asset value appreciation. This is at the lower  end of our target range, and we expect to  increase back to around the mid-30% level  as we build out the development pipeline.  Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 6.5 (2016: 6.9),  again within our target level of 6.0–7 .0,  which we intend to maintain. The Group also secured an investment  grade credit rating and arranged a new  £500 million, five-year unsecured debt  facility, providing additional financing  headroom, greater flexibility and a  reduced cost of funding.  Market and strategy The outlook for the student  accommodation sector remains  positive, with structural factors continuing  to drive a demand-supply imbalance in  the cities where we operate. The UK  Higher Education sector is recognised  globally for the strength of its Universities  and the contribution it makes to research,  innovation, talent development and the  UK economy more broadly. The UK is  the second most popular destination for  international students and has 12 out of  the world’s top 100 Universities and 59 of  Europe’s top 200 Universities. In February  2018, the Government announced a  Funding Review. The details of the review  are yet to be made clear but we do not  believe that it will not have a detrimental  impact on the UK’s globally-renowned  Higher Education sector. Total student numbers again reached  record levels at over 1.8 million. The  number of applicants and the number  of students accepted into courses in 2017  was at 700,000 and 534,000 respectively  (2016: 725,000 and 540,000). Despite a fall  in applications of 3%, Universities were able  to recruit from the excess of applications,  resulting in intake falling by less than  0.5% with applicants still outstripping  acceptances by 166,000. The small  reduction in applications was driven  principally by changes to funding for  some medical related courses and  a small reduction in EU students.  18 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Going forward, the gap between  the number of applicants and University  places could be impacted by some  external factors, including the impact  of the UK leaving the EU. Since 2015, a  demographic trend has seen a reduction  in the number of 18–21 year olds, and this  trend affects the next three years. However,  participation rates continue to increase  with applicants still outstripping the places  offered by Universities. We expect high and  mid-ranked Universities, where our business  is focused, to continue attracting more  students than those at the lower end of the  league tables and therefore we believe our  portfolio remains well placed to withstand  any potential reductions in applications.  The student accommodation sector  has attracted significant levels of capital  investment over the last four years with  over £16 billion of investment activity. This  increased investment activity has seen the  new supply of accommodation increase  and the total number of purpose-built  beds (including University-owned beds)  grow to 580,000 beds representing around  one-third of the UK’s student population.  At this level, there remains a shortage of  purpose-build accommodation compared  to the numbers of first years, international  and increasingly second and third-year  students. The outlook suggests that the  rate of new supply will continue at a similar  rate of around 25,000 beds in 2018, before  starting to reduce in 2019. Moreover, a large  proportion of the new supply is focused  on the premium end of the market and  we believe the competitive threat that it  poses to our more mainstream  proposition is limited. We believe our exposure to changes in  student numbers and increases in supply is  mitigated by our alignment and relationship  with high-quality Universities, underpinned  by nominations agreements, and remain  confident that well-located, mid-range,  direct-let student accommodation will  continue to support high levels of  occupancy and rental growth. Outlook Building on our consistent  performance record and supportive  market fundamentals the Group remains  well placed to deliver sustainable earnings  growth in the years ahead. UK Universities  continue to demonstrate their ability to  adapt and respond to a changing  landscape and retain their globally  recognised status. The demand for high  quality Higher Education among both  UK and international students continues  to grow. Our development pipeline and  operational expertise provides good  visibility of future rental growth and  increasing recurring earnings. We are  confident that our strategy of aligning  our operations with the best performing  Universities in the UK, combined with our  highly scalable operating platform,  strong brand and reputation makes us  well-positioned to extend our market  leading position.

Building on the strength of our brand  and our reputation with customers  and Universities, we entered our first  on-campus University partnership with  Aston University and secured two further  development-led University partnerships  with Oxford Brookes University and in  London with planning support from  King’s College, London.  Financial performance has again  been strong, with a total accounting  return of 14% and growth in EPRA earnings,  up 12% to £70.5 million. Profit before tax  was £229.4 million, which includes property  revaluations and disposal profits of £169.2  million (2016: £201.4 million and £136.3  million respectively). As a result of this  performance, we are declaring a final  dividend of 15.4p to deliver a total dividend  of 22.7p for the full year, an increase of 26%  year on year. Unite Students is a service brand and the  strong performance we have delivered  for our customers, University partners and  shareholders is only possible because of  the talent and hard work of our teams  across the business. On behalf of the  Board, I would like to thank them for  another excellent year. I would also like to take this opportunity to  pay tribute to one of our Directors, Manjit  Wolstenholme, who sadly passed away  last November. Manjit was a friend and  colleague and her judgement, insight  and humanity will be greatly missed. The recent success of the business is  founded on a consistent strategy and we  will continue to focus on delivering its main  elements: providing a great service for our  students and University partners; delivering  quality buildings designed around student  needs; and generating high-quality  earnings and maintaining a strong  capital structure. The outlook for our market remains  positive, with ongoing structural growth  being generated by the strength of the  world-renowned UK Higher Education  sector, increasing participation rates, the  internationalisation of Higher Education  and the shortage of housing in the UK.  Whilst the ongoing Brexit negotiations  and political landscape in the UK present  a backdrop of some uncertainty, these  sector fundamentals, together with  our high-quality portfolio, University  relationships and market-leading  operating platform, position us to  continue performing well in the  years to come. Given our confidence in the sector and  the sustainability of our business model,  the Board has agreed to increase our  dividend pay-out ratio to 85 per cent  of EPRA earnings in 2018 onwards. Phil White Chairman 21 February 2018 Board priorities The highlights of the year included:  - Deepening our University  partnerships  - Continually improving our  customer service  - High-quality portfolio aligned  to the strongest Universities  - Invest in recruiting, retaining and  developing quality people  - Focus on long-term, sustainable  earnings growth   Read more about  Building on our core principles on p20 Phil White Chairman Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 13 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 '"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":46}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Zc9ZEBoFpZoZ"},"source":["test_data['Summary_Text'] = summary_list"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SUEFxRPHpbgZ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":234},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637138593533,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":312,"user":{"displayName":"김보경","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg-s8HxaC3FlnLUp7n72YISxHbUG7x779SK7V-bIg=s64","userId":"06483416928080197927"}},"outputId":"86341280-0133-4adb-de11-29a747b7acfc"},"source":["test_data.set_index(['Original_Filename_x', 'Gold_Filename'], inplace=True)\n","test_data2 = test_data[['Document', 'Full_Text', 'Summary_Text']]\n","test_data2.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Document</th>\n","      <th>Full_Text</th>\n","      <th>Summary_Text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Original_Filename_x</th>\n","      <th>Gold_Filename</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30777_904926_2</th>\n","      <th>30777_904925_1</th>\n","      <td>30777</td>\n","      <td>25695    19 March 2018 3:29 PM    Proof 7 02 ...</td>\n","      <td>25695    19 March 2018 3:29 PM    Proof 7 A. ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30778_904963_2</th>\n","      <th>30778_904961_1</th>\n","      <td>30778</td>\n","      <td>10 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Chi...</td>\n","      <td>6 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 A ye...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30781_905026_2</th>\n","      <th>30781_905033_1</th>\n","      <td>30781</td>\n","      <td>Results Corero revenue for the year ended 31 ...</td>\n","      <td>Corero Network Security plc Annual Report &amp; A...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30783_905079_2</th>\n","      <th>30783_905078_1</th>\n","      <td>30783</td>\n","      <td>STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT ...</td>\n","      <td>Summary FY17 was a landmark year in Alpha’s h...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30790_905290_2</th>\n","      <th>30790_905289_1</th>\n","      <td>30790</td>\n","      <td>2017 has been a year of  significant change f...</td>\n","      <td>Sir Richard Lapthorne Chairman 2017 has been ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                   Document  ...

structure as at 30 june 2017, the group had a net cash balance of pound 723.7m 2016 pound 592.0m , ahead of expectations , driven by strong performance and the timing of land and working capital payments . we expect to have low levels of average net debt throughout the year and fy18 year-end net cash to be around pound 500m . we seek to defer payment for land purchases where possible to drive a higher roce , and land creditors as at 30 june 2017 were 37 percent of the owned land bank 30 june 2016 38 percent . we continue to secure attractive deferred payment terms on land and expect land creditors as a proportion of the owned land bank to reduce slightly and be around 30-35 percent at 30 june 2018, in line with our operating framework . the group continues to maintain an appropriate financial structure with shareholders’ funds and land creditors funding the longer term requirements of the business and with term loans and bank debt funding shorter term requirements for working capital . in december , we further strengthened working capital capacity by amending and extending our existing revolving credit facility , removing the pound 150m stepdown in facility size previously

taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment . this has a ten year maturity with a fixed coupon of 2.77 percent which is significantly lower than the maturing uspp that had a fixed rate of interest of 8.14 percent . following these financing changes we expect interest costs for fy18 to be around pound 50m of which c . pound 15m will be cash interest costs . net tangible assets

Following our success with planning over the  past 12 months we are very well positioned,  with all of our expected FY18 completions  (2016: 99.7% of FY17 completions) having  outline or full planning consent. Improving efficiency and reducing costs Improving the efficiency of our operations and  controlling costs continues to be a high priority  for the Group, as it will further enhance  our margin.  In 2016, the Group undertook a fundamental  review of its Barratt and David Wilson housing  ranges.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     15 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Increased activity levels across the industry  in terms of site openings and production  volumes combined with shortages of skilled  staff has contributed to an increased risk of  accidents on sites. We remain fully committed  to the highest standards of health and safety  on our sites. In the year, our reportable injury  incidence rate has decreased slightly with  379 (2016: 385) reportable incidents per  100,000 employees.  The tragic events at Grenfell Tower in London  illustrate why health and safety must always  remain the first priority for the building  industry. Fire safety is core to the way we plan  and build our developments. Following the  fire at Grenfell Tower, we conducted a review  of our sites and continue to ensure we  are maintaining the highest standards of  building safety. Delivery of our strategic objectives We delivered on our financial targets, set in  September 2014, of a minimum ROCE of 25%  and a 20% gross margin for FY17 and we are  focused on making further progress. With our  improved Capital Return Plan, announced  with our interim results in February 2017, we  continue to deliver attractive cash returns. Our key financial metrics Our housebuilding business achieved a gross  margin of 20.2% (2016: 19.1%) up 1.1 ppts and  an operating margin of 17.4% (2016: 15.9%) up  1.5 ppts reflecting the improvements we have  driven through the business, notwithstanding  that the high-end London market presents   some headwinds in this regard. The Group   delivered a gross margin of 20.0% (2016:   18.9%) and an operating margin of 17.2%  (2016: 15.8%) up 1.4 ppts on the prior year.  We have achieved our ROCE target with ROCE  increasing by 2.7 ppts to 29.8% (2016: 27.1%).  Contributing to this growth has been our  increased operating profitability, use of land  creditors and the disposal of our legacy shared  equity interests. It remains a core part of our  strategy to drive ROCE performance further,  in\\xa0line with our fast build and sell model. Maintaining an appropriate  capital\\xa0structure As at 30 June 2017, the Group had a net cash  balance of £723.7m (2016: £592.0m), ahead  of\\xa0expectations, driven by strong performance  and the timing of land and working capital  payments. We expect to have low levels of  average net debt throughout the year and FY18  year-end net cash to be around £500m. We seek to defer payment for land purchases  where possible to drive a higher ROCE, and  land creditors as at 30 June 2017 were 37%  of the owned land bank (30 June 2016: 38%).  We continue to secure attractive deferred  payment terms on land and expect land  creditors as a proportion of the owned  land bank to reduce slightly and be around  30-35% at 30 June 2018, in\\xa0line with our  operating framework. The Group continues to maintain an  appropriate financial structure with  shareholders’ funds and land creditors funding  the longer term requirements of the business  and with term loans and bank debt funding  shorter term requirements for working capital.  In December, we further strengthened working  capital capacity by amending and extending  our existing revolving credit facility, removing  the £150m stepdown in facility size previously  due in December 2017 and extending our  £700m facility to December 2021.  In August 2017, the Group refinanced the  maturing US$80m US Private Placement  (USPP) with a new USPP of £200m, taking  advantage of the current low interest rate  environment. This has a ten year maturity with  a fixed coupon of 2.77% which is significantly  lower than the maturing USPP that had a  fixed rate of interest of 8.14%. Following these  financing changes we expect interest costs for  FY18 to be around £50m of which c. £15m will  be cash interest costs. Net tangible assets were £3,430.0m (£3.40 per  share) of which land net of land creditors and  work in progress totalled £3,340.7m   (£3.31 per share). Capital Return Plan In February, the Board announced that, given  the significant operational and financial  improvements the Group has made over the  last few years, it would improve and extend  the existing dividend plan announced in  September 2014. As a result, the Group has  improved the level of ordinary dividend cover  from three times to two and a half times, and  thereby increased the dividend payout ratio. When market conditions allow, ordinary  dividends will be supplemented with the  payment of special dividends. The Board  proposes to pay special dividends of £175m in  November 2017 and November 2018.  We are therefore delighted to propose a final  dividend of 17.1 pence per share (2016: 12.3  pence per share) resulting in a total ordinary  dividend for the year up 33.3% to 24.4 pence  per share (2016: 18.3 pence per share) and  the third of our special dividends totalling  £175.0m, equivalent to 17.3 pence per share.  Both dividends will be paid on 20 November  2017 to all shareholders on the register at the  close of business on 27 October 2017.
