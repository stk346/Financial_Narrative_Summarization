This\\xa0“self-generated” element of our  business, combined with the high proportion  of sales that derive from end users’  maintenance and operating budgets, and  the wide diversity of the markets we serve,  both geographically and by industry sector,  makes our business highly resilient, although  not immune, to the vagaries of the markets. Strategy implementation Four years ago we undertook an extensive  strategic review and developed our strategy  for growth, the aim of which is to deliver  self-generated growth that outperforms our  markets. We identified six Group strategic  themes, which help us to do better what we  already do well:  − increase direct sales effectiveness through  sector focus;  − develop the knowledge and skills of our  expert sales and service teams;  − broaden our global presence;  − leverage R&D investments;  − optimise supply chain effectiveness; and  − operate sustainably and help improve our  customers’ sustainability. During 2017, notable progress was made in  the implementation of our strategic priorities,  which was a significant contributing factor to  the good financial results and strong organic  growth achieved during the year:  − We continued increasing the alignment  between our direct sales force and our  target industries of Food & Beverage;  Healthcare; Pharmaceutical; Oil, Gas  & Chemical; and OEM customers,  supported by developments in our R&D  processes, manufacturing capabilities,  marketing and training materials. In the  Spirax-Sarco Steam Specialties division,  the organic growth rate of these priority  sectors strongly outpaced the growth  rate of the other sectors. These priority  sectors now represent almost 50% of  the division’ s sales, compared to 40% in  2014. Also noteworthy, the strategically  prioritised Controls and Thermal Energy  Management (TEM) products, which  represent around 40% of sales and  are the main constituents of our self- generated solution sales, are growing at  a much faster pace than the traditional  Condensate Management products.   − We continued to strengthen the  knowledge and skills of our sales and  service teams and to develop our pipeline  of talent. By the end of the year the  training materials of the Spirax Sarco  Academy, which was established in 2016  to oversee the learning and development  of the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties  division, were available in 16 languages  and we had rolled out the Academy’ s  initial programmes to almost 1,100  customer-facing employees. Building on  the success of our UK Steam Specialties  award winning graduate programme, we  established a Global Group Graduate  Programme to attract and develop  talented young engineers.  − We again expanded our geographical  reach, with four new operating units  commencing trading at the start of the  year: Spirax Sarco East Africa (Kenya),  Watson-Marlow Indonesia, Watson- Marlow Thailand and Watson-Marlow  Vietnam, and established a Spirax  Sarco direct sales presence in Greece,  Sri Lanka and Morocco, and in UAE to  support Watson-Marlow sales expansion  in the Middle East. In recognition of  our successful international growth, in  2017 Watson-Marlow Ltd and BioPure  T echnology Ltd won a combined Queen’ s  Award for Enterprise, in the International  Trade category. “ Notable progress was made in the implementation  of our strategic priorities, which was a significant  contributing factor to the good financial results and  strong organic growth achieved during the year.” Nicholas Anderson   Group Chief Executive  Introduction Our Company purpose is to help our  customers and end users implement  environmentally-friendly engineered solutions  for energy savings, process efficiency,  product quality and improvements in plant  health, safety and regulatory compliance,  and to engineer sustainable value for  stakeholders. We do this through having  the right products, in the right place, at the  right time, and an extensive global network  of over 1,600 expert sales and service  engineers with the knowledge and skills  required to understand customers’ difficult  operational challenges and design bespoke  engineered solutions to resolve them. Our direct sales business model is highly  effective at uncovering opportunities to  improve customers’ steam systems,  electrical heating and temperature  management systems, or fluid path  processes. As they walk our customers’  facilities, our specialist engineers are  able to identify unrecognised needs.  The engineered solutions required to meet  these needs generally have a relatively short  payback period of around 24 months or  less and, crucially, are typically paid for out  of our customers’ operational budgets.  Purchasing decisions are therefore made at  operational level from budgets, which are  Strategic Report  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 07  − We made two significant acquisitions,  Gestra and Chromalox, which increased  our market share and expanded our  addressable market and successfully  integrated the two acquisitions made in  2016, Aflex and Hiter Controls.   − Almost thirty new products were launched  during 2017. Watson-Marlow launched  the innovative and award-winning  Quantum peristaltic bioprocessing pump  with patented ReNu SU T echnology®  cartridge, which offers a step change  in pump technology enabling higher  downstream process yields with minimum  pulsation throughout the pressure range.  Other product launches from Watson- Marlow include: a patented single-handed  and tool free sanitary tri-clamp for use in  the Biopharmaceutical industry, called  QClamp, from BioPure; the Flexicon  PF7, a benchtop filling pump for use  in cleanroom environments; and range  extensions of the Certa pump, for use in  the Food & Beverage industry. The Spirax  Sarco Steam Specialties division launched  multiple new products including the  SIMS™ Software energy monitoring  and targeting solution, which enables  real-time monitoring and visualisation of  customers’ steam and thermal energy  systems. Amongst other new product  introductions, Chromalox introduced the  CCX Cast Block Heater, for use in high  pressure environments; and the CXHXD  corrosion-resistant, explosion-proof Unit  Heater, for use in hazardous or challenging  environments, such as offshore  drilling platforms.  − T o further develop the capacity and  efficiency of our supply chain, we  accelerated the capital investment  programmes designed to modernise and  renew our manufacturing equipment and  completed the expansion of our state- of-the-art manufacturing facility in China.  We also established a new distribution  hub for the Steam Specialties division in  Singapore, which is designed to improve  the efficient distribution of products  and increase customer service levels  throughout the Asia Pacific region.  − The implementation of the Group  Sustainability Strategy remained a key  priority and good progress was made  in a number of areas. During the year  we increased the number of Health and  Safety professionals within the business,  rolled out our Supplier Sustainability Code  to direct suppliers of our sales companies,  established a network of community  engagement champions across the Group  and launched a Community Engagement  Award to recognise and raise awareness  of the activities that are taking place  across the Group. We also reduced our  global carbon emissions intensity by 4%. Acquisitions Our Group acquisitions strategy outlines our  key acquisition criteria. Acquisitions should:  − have the potential to create significant  shareholder value and either increase  our addressable market into related  sectors or expand the capabilities of our  niche businesses through new skills,  technologies or geographic coverage;  − serve customers through a direct sales  business model;  − increase sales in our core markets;  − provide products or services where there  is a high cost of non-performance to  the customer;  − have the potential for geographical or  technology expansion;  − have strong maintenance, repair and  overhaul demand and recurring revenues;  and  − be capable of achieving Group margins. During 2017, a unique opportunity arose to  acquire two outstanding businesses, Gestra  and Chromalox. Both companies have long  and successful histories. Industrial boiler  controls and steam specialist Gestra  was founded in Germany in 1902 and  electrical process heating and temperature  management solutions provider Chromalox  was founded in the USA in 1917, with both  companies bringing distinct opportunities for  growth and expansion to the Group.  Gestra’ s strength in a number of product  areas, such as industrial boiler control  systems, and end applications, such as the  German chemical industry, complement the  Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties division’ s  product offering and industry reach. With the  help of the Spirax Sarco global footprint,  we believe that the combination of the  two entities will enhance organic growth  opportunities going forward.  Chromalox represents an excellent  opportunity to expand our addressable  markets through the acquisition of a clearly  related business that is also dedicated  to transferring heat energy into industrial  processes and shares our strong direct  sales business model. As we invest in  strengthening Chromalox’ s direct sales  channels and leverage our global footprint  and expertise, this acquisition will enhance  our growth and sustainable value creation for  customers and shareholders. Both acquisitions were accretive to Group  earnings in 2017 and were positively  received by customers and employees.  The integration of both businesses into  the Group has proceeded very positively  and remains in line with the integration  plans reported at the time of their  respective acquisitions.

25695 19 march 2018 3 29 pm proof 7 02 s . c . harris group chief executive chief executive’s review 2017 has once again demonstrated the quality of bodycote’s business . the group’s revenue growth , combined with continued discipline on costs , helped lift headline operating profit by 24 percent . return on sales increased to 18.0 percent from 16.6 percent . s . c . harris group chief executive overview bodycote reported revenue growth of 14.9 percent to pound 690.2m 2016 pound 600.6m , with revenue benefiting from foreign exchange translation gain . at constant currency , revenues grew 9.6 percent , including a contribution of 2.9 percent from acquisitions completed in 2016. the following review reflects constant currency growth rates unless stated otherwise . general industrial markets returned to growth after a multi- year negative trend . moreover , this growth was broad-based , with improvements in general industrial demand occurring in all of our served geographies . group revenues generated from the general industrial sectors , which represent some 39 percent of our business , grew 10 percent , which was well above the growth in background demand . of this growth , 4 percentage points came from acquisitions made in 2016. the remainder of the group’s outperformance in general industrial versus the market came from the increased penetration of specialist technologies which grew 14 percent in this sector , as well as an element of some customer restocking . the decision we took to preserve the capacity at our t exas oklahoma facilities is being well rewarded , as we have also seen a reversal of the sharp declines that we had experienced in onshore oil gas demand . growth in onshore oil gas saw a strong sequential increase in 2017 , driven predominantly by demand from unconventional drilling activity in the permian basin . in the rest of the energy sector , subsea revenues continued to decline and large-frame industrial gas turbines igt are also in retreat following cutbacks at the original equipment manufacturers oems . it is worth noting , however , that requests for quotation in the subsea sector have picked up considerably . in total , revenues from the energy sector increased by 4 percent . civil aviation grew 6 percent with our uk operations continuing to add significant business . this increase will require new facilities to be built in 2018 in the uk in order to service forecast demand . north america also started to contribute to the growth in a more meaningful way as the build rate of leap engines continues to grow . bodycote has a much stronger position on the leap series than it did on the previous cfm56, which is a testament to the success of the focused sales and investment programme that has been undertaken over the last decade . 08 bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 december 2017 25695 19 march 2018 3 29 pm proof 7 the automotive business saw growth of 14 percent with the majority of this increase coming from the car and light truck sector . this compares to background demand growth in europe of low single digits and a slight decline in the usa . our strong performance benefited from the contribution from the acquisitions made in 2016, together with the investments we have made in emerging markets and specialist t echnologies . in our specialist technologies , we achieved double-digit revenue growth across our specialty stainless steel processes s 3 p , low pressure carburising lpc and corr-i-dur cid technologies . however , several factors dragged on overall sales growth during the year . the hip product fabrication hip pf and surface technology businesses are focused largely on oil gas outside of the usa , with particular emphasis on subsea and these revenues continued to decline . in addition the weakness in igt volumes resulted in a slowdown in the hip services business towards the end of the year . also impacting our hip services business was an unplanned outage during the second half which was fully resolved by year end . forecast growth in all the specialist technologies looks strong . the five sites we acquired in 2016 are performing well . they are all classical heat treatment sites within the agi division and contributed pound 23.0m of revenue in 2017 , with return on sales in line with the group . it is also worth highlighting that revenues at these facilities have accelerated since coming into the group as a result of the benefits derived from being part of the group’s network of facilities . with careful cost discipline in the face of growing revenues , the group’s headline operating profit grew 24 percent to pound 123.9m 26 percent growth in statutory operating profit to pound 119.4m and the return on sales improved to 18.0 percent 2016 16.6 percent . once again , we increased our prices ahead of cost inflation . this is an area of heightened focus for the group especially as we are entering a period of higher input cost inflation in some markets . it is worth noting , however , that bodycote typically performs well in higher inflationary environments . the group’s strong profit improvement , coupled with a headline tax rate of 22.9 percent 2016 27 .5 percent , increased basic headline earnings per share to 49.2p 2016 37 .0p . basic earnings per share increased to 51 .0p from 35.2p . the return on capital employed rose in the current year to 19.3 percent from 17 .1 percent in 2016. free cash flow increased to pound 83.0m 2016 pound 60.5m as a result of our improved profitability and in spite of increased capital expenditure to support the future growth of the business . headline operating cash conversion was , once again , above 90 percent , yielding a net cash position at the end of the year of pound 39.6m 2016 pound 1 .1m . strategic progress the group’s strategy encompasses the drive for operational efficiency and improvement in return on sales growth in markets with higher long term structural growth the expansion of the group’s footprint in rapid growth markets the focus on revenue growth in specialist technologies and growth through targeted acquisitions , where these are more attractive than investing in new facilities . the group has a minimum 20 percent hurdle rate return when looking at investments . during 2017 we made further progress against our strategy , delivering higher group return on sales of 18.0 percent . we believe there is still the opportunity to further improve from both management led initiatives , particularly in our agi division , and growth in our higher return specialist technologies . in 2017 we continued to invest in areas with superior growth potential , with a deliberate bias towards investments in rapid- growth markets , specialist technologies , and long-cycle programmes , particularly in civil aviation emerging markets revenues increased 26 percent to pound 54.1m , representing 8 percent of group turnover , with growth in mexico and china both above 40 percent . we will continue to invest to support the future of our business in these rapid growth markets . during the year , we commissioned several new lpc

chief executive’s review 2017 has once again demonstrated the quality of bodycote’s business . the group’s revenue growth , combined with continued discipline on costs , helped lift headline operating profit by 24 percent . return on sales increased to 18.0 percent from 16.6 percent . s . c . harris group chief executive overview bodycote reported revenue growth of 14.9 percent to pound 690.2m 2016 pound 600.6m , with revenue benefiting from foreign exchange translation gain . at constant currency , revenues grew 9.6 percent , including a contribution of 2.9 percent from acquisitions completed in 2016. the following review reflects constant currency growth rates unless stated otherwise . general industrial markets returned to growth after a multi- year negative trend . moreover , this growth was broad-based , with improvements in general industrial demand occurring in all of our served geographies . group revenues generated from the general industrial sectors , which represent some 39 percent of our business , grew 10 percent , which was well above the growth in background demand . of this growth , 4 percentage points came from acquisitions made in 2016. the remainder of the group’s outperformance in general industrial versus the market came from the increased penetration of specialist technologies which grew 14 percent in this sector , as well as an element of some customer restocking . the decision we took to preserve the capacity at our t exas oklahoma facilities is being well rewarded , as we have also seen a reversal of the sharp declines that we had experienced in onshore oil gas demand . growth in onshore oil gas saw a strong sequential increase in 2017 , driven predominantly by demand from unconventional drilling activity in the permian basin . in the rest of the energy sector , subsea revenues continued to decline and large-frame industrial gas turbines igt are also in retreat following cutbacks at the original equipment manufacturers oems . it is worth noting , however , that requests for quotation in the subsea sector have picked up considerably . in total , revenues from the energy sector increased by 4 percent . civil aviation grew 6 percent with our uk operations continuing to add significant business . this increase will require new facilities to be built in 2018 in the uk in order to service forecast demand . north america also started to contribute to the growth in a more meaningful way as the build rate of leap engines continues to grow . bodycote has a much stronger position on the leap series than it did on the previous cfm56, which is a testament to the success of the focused sales and investment programme that has been undertaken over the last decade . 08 bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 december 2017 25695 19 march 2018 3 29 pm proof 7 the automotive business saw growth of 14 percent with the majority of this increase coming from the car and light truck sector . this compares to background demand growth in europe of low single digits and a slight decline in the usa . our strong performance benefited from the contribution from the acquisitions made in 2016, together with the investments we have made in emerging markets and specialist t echnologies . in our specialist technologies , we achieved double-digit revenue growth across our specialty stainless steel processes s 3 p , low pressure carburising lpc and corr-i-dur cid technologies . however , several factors dragged on overall sales growth during the year . the hip product fabrication hip pf and surface technology businesses are focused largely on oil gas outside of the usa , with particular emphasis on subsea and these revenues continued to decline . in addition the weakness in igt volumes resulted in a slowdown in the hip services business towards the end of the year . also impacting our hip services business was an unplanned outage during the second half which was fully resolved by year end . forecast growth in all the specialist technologies looks strong . the five sites we acquired in 2016 are performing well . they are all classical heat treatment sites within the agi division and contributed pound 23.0m of revenue in 2017 , with return on sales in line with the group . it is also worth highlighting that revenues at these facilities have accelerated since coming into the group as a result of the benefits derived from being part of the group’s network of facilities . with careful cost discipline in the face of growing revenues , the group’s headline operating profit grew 24 percent to pound 123.9m 26 percent growth in statutory operating profit to pound 119.4m and the return on sales improved to 18.0 percent 2016 16.6 percent . once again , we increased our prices ahead of cost inflation . this is an area of heightened focus for the group especially as we are entering a period of higher input cost inflation in some markets . it is worth noting , however , that bodycote typically performs well in higher inflationary environments . the group’s strong profit improvement , coupled with a headline tax rate of 22.9 percent 2016 27 .5 percent , increased basic headline earnings per share to 49.2p 2016 37 .0p . basic earnings per share increased to 51 .0p from 35.2p . the return on capital employed rose in the current year to 19.3 percent from 17 .1 percent in 2016. free cash flow increased to pound 83.0m 2016 pound 60.5m as a result of our improved profitability and in spite of increased capital expenditure to support the future growth of the business . headline operating cash conversion was , once again , above 90 percent , yielding a net cash position at the end of the year of pound 39.6m 2016 pound 1 .1m . strategic progress the group’s strategy encompasses the drive for operational efficiency and improvement in return on sales growth in markets with higher long term structural growth the expansion of the group’s footprint in rapid growth markets the focus on revenue growth in specialist technologies and growth through targeted acquisitions , where these are more attractive than investing in new facilities . the group has a minimum 20 percent hurdle rate return when looking at investments . during 2017 we made further progress against our strategy , delivering higher group return on sales of 18.0 percent . we believe there is still the opportunity to further improve from both management led initiatives , particularly in our agi division , and growth in our higher return specialist technologies . in 2017 we continued to invest in areas with superior growth potential , with a deliberate bias towards investments in rapid- growth markets , specialist technologies , and long-cycle programmes , particularly in civil aviation emerging markets revenues increased 26 percent to pound 54.1m , representing 8 percent of group turnover , with growth in mexico and china both above 40 percent . we will continue to invest to support the future of our business in these rapid growth markets . during the year , we commissioned several new lpc and s 3 p lines . in hip services we acquired the hip assets from doncasters group limited’s uk business and a new mega-hip was ordered for europe which will come online in 2018. further new facilities are expected to be commissioned in 2018 for both specialist technologies and classical heat treatment in our focus geographies and markets . the additional capacity that will come on stream in 2018 will add to our ability to deliver strong growth and superior return on sales over the coming years . we also continue to look at acquisition and investment opportunities that will grow our business . these are traditionally small bolt-on facilities that can provide us with
