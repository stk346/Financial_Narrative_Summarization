We further upgraded and  expanded our store estate, continued the evolution of  the\\xa0Topps Tiles offer and supported this with new  marketing initiatives in-store, on television and online.  In\\xa0addition, we made some significant infrastructure  investments across the business, which will benefit  our\\xa0future performance. Prudent management of all costs remained a key focus.  In addition we also reviewed a number of our retail  processes to both further improve our proposition to  customers and enhance financial performance. The economic environment has continued to be  challenging and, in particular, we saw a slowing in  customer numbers during the second half of our financial  period. That said, the business remains financially well  positioned and the strong operational progress made  during the year will enable us to continue to progress  our\\xa0growth\\xa0plans. t he Market  Topps has seen its position as the UK’s leading tile  retailer strengthen further during the period, with our  share of the non-contract tile market growing to 26%  (2010: 25%) (source: MBD). Our unwavering focus  on\\xa0offering our customers outstanding service and  value\\xa0enabled the Group to, once again, outperform  the\\xa0market. Tile consumption in the UK continues to be low in  comparison to the rest of Europe (roughly one third of the  demand experienced in Northern Europe, source: MBD).  However long-term growth, based on projections of an  increase in housing stock and consumer usage of tiles,  remains attractive. Against this background we believe  there is potential for up to 400 Topps Tiles stores in  the\\xa0UK. st Or e devel OPMent and exPansi On With a continuing backdrop of challenging trading  conditions our focus has been on optimising returns from  the existing store estate by adding new stores selectively  and targeting tactical re-sites of individual stores where  this is supported by the local market opportunity. Over recent years our store expansion strategy was  realigned to reflect the deterioration in the economic  environment. In the 2009/10 financial period we  returned to growth in store numbers and this activity  accelerated in the period under review. In the last  12\\xa0months we opened 15 new stores and closed  seven\\xa0stores (of which three were relocations), resulting  in\\xa0a net increase of eight stores and completing the  financial period with 320 stores. New store openings  have performed well and we are very satisfied with the  return on investment. In the year ahead we have plans  in\\xa0place to increase the size of the business by  approximately five new stores. We have continued with our programme of converting  Tile Clearing House stores into the more profitable  Topps\\xa0Tiles format and have completed five in the  financial period. Trading results from these conversions  have been pleasing and a further 15 are planned for the  year ahead. This will leave 16 Tile Clearing House stores  which will function as clearance units for the Topps stores. Our improved and expanded website was relaunched  during the period. The response has been very  encouraging, with record numbers of people visiting the  site and staying online for longer periods than ever  before. Our online presence is now an increasingly  important factor in driving store footfall as a growing  number of customers undertake the research phase of  their project online before visiting our stores. To help them  with this process we have introduced more inspirational  room set photography, a greater variety of design ideas  and a completely new market-leading interactive  “visualiser”. This enables customers to choose from our  extensive range of wall and floor tiles and model them  into a variety of different room settings.

While\\xa0we expect the primary role of the website to  remain as a customer research tool, it is also playing  a\\xa0growing role as a direct sales channel, with online  revenues now representing around 1.5% of sales  (2010:\\xa01%). We expect this to continue to grow and  play an ever increasing role in our customer offer. in Fr astructure During the period we completed the construction of  our\\xa0second warehousing facility at our Leicestershire  headquarters at a cost of c.£3 million. This warehouse  is\\xa0now fully operational and will form a key part of our  logistics strategy over the coming years, giving us the  operational capacity for up to 400 stores. In particular,  the additional capacity will allow us to source more  products direct from the manufacturer, decreasing the  proportion sourced via third party distributors and  delivering a gross margin benefit. During the next financial period we will be implementing  a new\\xa0enterprise-wide information technology system  of\\xa0which the majority of the implementation will occur  in\\xa0the second half. This new system, which will add  much\\xa0greater functionality across a range of disciplines,  will be\\xa0a key enabler for a number of new processes  and\\xa0customer initiatives. The total cost of the system  implementation will be approximately £1 million, the  majority of which has been spent in this financial period. c ust OMer service As the UK’s leading tile specialist, the provision  of\\xa0exceptional levels of customer service is a key  differentiator of the Topps Tiles brand. Over the course of the last year we have changed the  way we measure customer satisfaction and adopted the  Net Promoter Scoring system. The score is calculated  based on customers’ feedback to the question of how  likely they are to recommend Topps Tiles to friends or  colleagues. The scores are based on a numerical scale  from 0–10 which allows customers to be split into  promoters (9–10), passives (7–8) and detractors (0–6).  The final score is based on the percentage of promoters  less the percentage of detractors, thereby creating  a\\xa0possible range of –100% to +100%. Over the  financial period we have scored 88.1% against this  measure and consider this a very clear endorsement  of\\xa0our customer service ethic. The measure used  for\\xa02010 is not directly\\xa0comparable. Marketing, advertising  and\\xa0 sPOn sOr shi P The evolution of the Topps Tiles brand continued during  the period, in line with our greater emphasis on inspiring  customers and reaching beyond our traditional customer  base. Our product brochures and in-store merchandising  have been repositioned to reflect customers’ increased  focus on style as the principal driver in their purchase  decision. This approach also provides consistency  with\\xa0our improved consumer website. Greater emphasis  has\\xa0also been given to the breadth of our ranges,  with\\xa0a\\xa0greater focus on being able to attract high end  customers, as well as retaining those attracted by our  traditional value message. £175.5m Group revenue  (53 weeks ended 2 October 2010: £182.4m) £18.2m Adjusted operations profit 1 (53 weeks ended 2 October 2010: £21.1m 1 ) l atest inkjet technologies enhance our range  of stone-effect tiles. r epresenting the latest in our large   format tiles, this stylish range uses inkjet  technologies to create a distinctive marble  effect.

We continue to invest in their  professional development through a sophisticated in-store  e-learning system, which is developed and administered  in-house, providing new courses and regular updates.  During the year we rolled-out new programmes to equip  all store staff with the product and technical knowledge  to support our “customer inspiration” agenda, as well as  specialist sales skills training. The initial results from this  programme have been encouraging, with a greater  consistency of standards already evident across the  store\\xa0estate. All our staff are incentivised with competitive benefit  packages and performance based rewards, and we  encourage internal promotion. We anticipate that staffing  levels will increase in line with the progressive expansion  of the store base. c u rrent t r ading and Outl OOk In the first seven weeks of the new financial period,  Group revenues, which are on a like-for-like basis,  decreased by 6.9%. Looking ahead, we expect economic conditions will  remain difficult in 2012, with domestic budgets again  under pressure. Our response will be to take further cost  out of the business, grow margin and maximise sales  opportunities, while making operational improvements  that will position the business for future growth as  economic conditions improve.

Television advertising and sponsorship has  proved to be the most effective way to build consumer  awareness of the Topps brand. In the early part of the  period we ran a national weather sponsorship  campaign with ITV and subsequent TV campaigns  across a variety of national terrestrial and digital  channels have also been successful in driving store  footfall. To complement this we will continue to  communicate the inspirational range through home  interest magazines and PR. We are planning to sustain  a\\xa0similar level of marketing expenditure in the year  ahead. A trade-focused campaign will run in parallel  with the consumer campaign, in line with our strategy  of\\xa0securing a greater proportion of trade project spend.  cOMM u nity Topp’s commitment to its local communities through  sponsorship and charitable activity remains strong. We  aim to make positive contributions to those communities  served by our stores, working closely with them to  promote our primary aim of being a “good neighbour”. We currently sponsor over 300 youth football teams  nationwide, providing the teams with support, new kits  and equipment. Our work for the charity, Help for Heroes, which we  have been supporting since 2008, has gone from  strength to strength and we have already helped to raise  over £160,000 for this very worthy cause. We also  work with the British Association of Modern Mosaic  (“BAMM”), sponsoring two national competitions and  supporting the promotion of mosaic art in schools and  community groups countrywide. 14887_TT_AR11_p1-25.indd   7 07/12/2011   21:49 Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 201 1 8 Meeting our customers’ desires  to be inspired, our new style  guides help customers identify  looks and designs to suit their  living space.

chief executive officer’s statement the berong nickel mine has been in operation for just over one year and has successfully made shipments of laterite ore to chinese and australian customers . for the full year april 1 2007 through march 31 2008, approximately 467,278 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1.52 percent ni was shipped . from the commencement of trial metallurgical shipments in january 2007 until the end of june 2008, approximately 815,000 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1.52 percent ni was shipped into the market place . many of the temporary facilities put into place
